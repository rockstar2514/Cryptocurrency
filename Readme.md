# IITKBUCKS Application
<p>The repository is a Project I had taken under the Sciency and Technology Coucil,IIT Kanpur.<br>
The aim of the project was to create a functioning Block Chain Network where peers would<br>
be people designing their own nodes under this project<br></p>

## The Model
<p> Our Block Chain model was different from the actual Block Chain in a number of ways. <br>
Out Block Chain would work as follows :-<br>
A transaction would be sent by a user on to any node. This node would then forward it to its peers <br>
and the peer forwarding would continue so that the transaction propagates throught the entire network.<br>
As soon as a transaction is recieved by a node it is put on a queue to be mined by the respective node<br>
Now as many transactions that can be taken in are put in a Block and now the nonce hunting starts. The <br>
  first node to find the nonce sends the Block through the network and all nodes would add that Block <br>
  into their local BlockChain. This cycle would repeat again and again.
  
### Specifics
A transaction is made using Asymmetric Encryption. Each user has his own public key and private key which <br>
they can use to make and recieve transactions. The public key is the key that is shared publicly but the <br>
private key is kept private. In order to make transaction to a person, the sender attaches the recipient's <br>
public key in the transaction. This signifies that the transaction is made to a particular person. However,<br>
anyone can claim that this key is theirs,but in order to use the money attached to a particular public key,<br>
the corresponding private key is needed. Again, revealing private key can then be a risk because then other <br>
people who have seen the revealed private key can say that they have the private key too. For this purpose<br>
,signatures come into play. The basic idea is that if u encrypt a string with a private key , u can decrypt<br>
it only with the corresponding public key. Hence for this purpose we have used RSA-PSS Signatures with 32 Salt<br>
length.So, we need a string (bytes in fact) that is encrypted by the private key of a recipient and the signature<br>
generated by the recipient. However, if the string to be signed is fixed and the signature has been revealed then<br>
it can be used by anybody .For this purpose we design the string to be signed in a way that this string is used <br>
only once. This way a recipient can use his money securely and anonymously. For mining we use the SHA-256 hash of <br>
the binary data of the block which must be less than a particular target ( proof of work). In order to introduce <br>
psuedo randomness, we attach the timestamp of the instant at which a nonce is being tried.
